The synthesis of 7 can be achieved using different routes, depending on the desired product and the availability of starting materials. In this article, we will discuss some of the common synthetic routes for the preparation of 7 and its derivatives.\n\n### Route 1: Reduction of 2-chloropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid\n\nOne of the most common routes to prepare 7 is by reducing 2-chloropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid (1) with lithium metal in the presence of anhydrous copper(II) chloride. The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\n1 + Li + CuCl2 -> Cu(s) + LiCl\n\nThe copper(II) ion acts as a reductant and the lithium ion as a catalyst for the reduction of the chlorine ion. The resulting 7 can be isolated by dissolving the reaction mixture in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or n-hexane, and then filtering to remove any impurities.\n\n### Route 2: Reduction of 2-chloropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid with sodium borohydride\n\nAnother way to prepare 7 is by reducing 2-chloropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid (1) with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The reaction proceeds as follows:\n\n1 + 4NaBH4 + 1.5K2CO3 -> 2Na2CO3 + 4BH3NH4\n\nThe sodium borohydride acts as a reducing agent and the potassium carbonate as a base to neutralize the resulting hydrogen chloride gas. The resulting 7 can be isolated by dissolving the reaction mixture in a suitable solvent such as ethanol or n-hexane, and then filtering to remove any impurities.\n\n### Route 3: Reduction'}]",-4.96875,-3.9231298828125,-4.470835658482143
